## Files for the sparki robot

For now most of the stuff is play :)

- movementTest: This has code used to test movements; I used this to calculate how fast sparki is (2.78cm/sec); to do this you can use the moveForward function, it'll show the elapsed time to move that distance.  I found that sparki was off; it actually moved further than requested.  See the sparkiMovementAnalysis spreadsheet in the sparki_python repo for calculations I did.
